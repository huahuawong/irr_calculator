# IRR Calculator

Worked on a project where one of the tasks is to calculate inter-rater reliability (IRR). IRR measures the "level of agreement" between k number of raters and is commonly used in the healthcare indusrty to measure the consistency of the data. There are different ways to calculate IRR and depending on the nature of the data, we should pick the most suitable one. Thus, the IRR calculator is designed to allow individuals to calculate IRR using different methods on a web application.

The web application is designed using Streamlit and backend code with Python.
